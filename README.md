# robotic-arm-motion-prediction


This repository contains a dataset captured from a real-world robotic arm, used for motion analysis and machine learning tasks. The dataset includes multiple trajectories executed by the robotic arm, with data collected over three degrees of freedom (DOF) in three-dimensional space.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset captures angular rotation data of the robotic arm along the X, Y, and Z axes. It includes a total of 10,000 data points per trajectory, providing rich information on the robot's motion patterns. The data is meant for tasks such as robotic motion prediction, control, and analysis.

### **Features:**
- **Axis_X_Angle**: Angle of rotation around the X-axis of the robotic arm (in radians).
- **Axis_Y_Angle**: Angle of rotation around the Y-axis of the robotic arm (in radians).
- **Axis_Z_Angle**: Angle of rotation around the Z-axis of the robotic arm (in radians).

### **Data Details:**
- The dataset consists of several trajectories, each representing a sequence of movements performed by the robotic arm.
- Each trajectory is recorded over 10,000 data points, with variations due to factors like inertia, hydraulic response delay, and mechanical irregularities.
- The motion is captured in real-time, providing a real-world representation of robotic operations.
